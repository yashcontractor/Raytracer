<h1 align="center">Raytracer Program written in C++</h1>

Raytracing is widely used in 3D Computer Graphics and is commonly applied when creating games and animated Movies/TV shows.

<h1 align="left">Brief Description:</h1>
Due to my recent growing interest in 3D graphics, I decided to take the challenge to build a Raytracer program that takes the input positions of two distinct text files, and outputs an image in a .ppm file based on the camera and light positions decribed in the text files.

<h1 align="left">What is Raytracing?</h1>
A basic raytracing model includes a camera that is placed in a world and rays are caseed from the camera's position to points on an imaginary plane. A ray is used to determine what light would be going towards the camera at that specific point and directions. Each ray represents a pixel in the output image and the resulting color of the ray determines the color output for the pixel.

This image represents one of the output .ppm files produced by the program
